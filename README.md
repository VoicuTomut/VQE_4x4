# VQE_4x4

Hi! This is my approach for __Task 4__ from [QOSF Mentorship Programme 2020](https://qosf.org/qc_mentorship/).

General VQE was added later. For more details [VQE_Scratch](https://www.notion.so/VQE_Scratch-7d6ca0f3f44c4430a8e6202f7de779db)

To solve this problem I choose to use Qiskit and also I used SciPy optimizer.
